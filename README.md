# Morabaraba-2 recreated in python

This game can either be played locally, with both players on the same computer, or on a server. 

To play locally, simply run client.py where you'll be asked if you want to play locally and simply enter Y for yes.

To play on a server, the server computer needs to run the server.py program (which will display the servers ip). Then on the 
client computers run client.py where you'll be asked if you want to play locally simple type N for no. You'll then be prompted to enter the server's IP.
